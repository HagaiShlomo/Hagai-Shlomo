I received my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Ariel University under the supervision of Prof. Yosef Pinhasi and Dr. Balal Netzh I worked at Homeland Security Laboratory on Ministry of Defense (MAFAT) research. My research field was Implementation of antennas in the millimetric spectrum using 
3D modelling, printing and painting with nanometric conductors.
The design of the antennas is being done by using the CST simulator and 3D 
printed.
